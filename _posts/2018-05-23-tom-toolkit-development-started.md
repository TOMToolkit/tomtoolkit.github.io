Development of the TOM Toolkit has begun. The project is open source
and can be viewed [on Github](https://github.com/TOMToolkit/tom_base).

The project is in a very early stage but anyone interested in it's
development are encouraged to reach out. We are also available in
the project's IRC channel: irc.freenode.net #tomtoolkit


Clear skies!
