## SNEx

The [Supernova Exchange](https://supernova.exchange/public/) is an interface for viewing and sharing observational data of supernovae, and for requesting and managing observations with the Las Cumbres Observatory network. In order to make it more maintainable, it is being rewritten from scratch using the TOM Toolkit, which has already resulted in orders of magnitude fewer lines of code. The code can be found and referenced on [Github](https://github.com/jfrostburke/snex2/).

## Asteroid Tracker

[Asteroid Tracker](https://asteroidtracker.lco.global/) is an educational TOM built for Asteroid Day. It allows students and teachers to submit one-click observations of specific asteroids and see the resulting images. Originally built from scratch, it's being rewritten using the TOM Toolkit, which will allow the underlying TOM to be used with multiple front-ends for completely different educational purposes.

## Microlensing TOM

The [Microlensing TOM](https://github.com/KSNikolaus/ZTF_TOM) is being written in order to identify microlensing events from ZTF and conduct follow-up observations.

## PhotTOM

The [ROME/REA TOM](https://github.com/rachel3834/romerea_phot_tom) is being built to manage ROME/REA photometry for the [LCO key project of the same name](https://robonet.lco.global/).

## Others

There are a few other TOMs in development that we're aware of, but if you're developing a TOM, feel free to contribute to this page, or let us know and we'll take care of it for you.
