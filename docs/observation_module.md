title: Writing an observation module to interface with observatories
---

This guide will walk you through how to create a custom observation facility
module using some mocked up endpoints to simulate a real observatory interface.

You can use this example as the foundation to build an observing facility module
to connect to a real observatory.

Be sure you've followed the [Getting Started](/docs/getting_started) guide before continuing onto this tutorial.

## What is a observing facility module?

A TOM Toolkit observing facility module is a python module which contains the code
necessary to provide an interface to an observing facility in a TOM. Some examples
of existing modules are the [Las Cumbres
Observatory](https://github.com/TOMToolkit/tom_base/blob/master/tom_observations/facilities/lco.py)
and the
[Gemini](https://github.com/TOMToolkit/tom_base/blob/master/tom_observations/facilities/gemini.py)
modules. Both allow the submission of observation requests to their respective
observatories through a TOM.

### Prerequisites

You should have a working TOM already. You can start where the [Getting
Started](/docs/getting_started) guide leaves off. You should also be familiar with
the observing facility's API that you would like to work with.

### Defining the minimal implementation

Within any existing module in your TOM you should create a new python module
(file) named `myfacility.py`. For example, if you have a fresh TOM installation
you'll have a directory structure that looks something like this:

    ├── data
    ├── db.sqlite3
    ├── manage.py
    ├── mytom
    │   ├── __init__.py
    │   ├── settings.py
    │   ├── urls.py
    │   └── wsgi.py
    ├── static
    ├── templates
    └── tmp

We'll place our `myfacility.py` file inside the `mytom` directory, next to
`settings.py`.

```python
from tom_observations.facility import GenericObservationFacility, GenericObservationForm


class MyObservationFacilityForm(GenericObservationForm):
    pass


class MyObservationFacility(GenericObservationFacility):
    name = 'MyFacility'
    form = MyObservationFacilityForm
```

We'll go over what these lines mean soon. First, we'll add a setting to our
project's `settings.py` to tell the TOM Toolkit to use our new class:

```python
TOM_FACILITY_CLASSES = [
    'tom_observations.facilities.lco.LCOFacility',
    'tom_observations.facilities.gemini.GEMFacility',
    'mytom.myfacility.MyObservationFacility'
]
```

Now go ahead and view a target in your TOM, you should see something like this:

![myfacility](/assets/img/observation_module/myfacility.png)

This means our new observation facility module has been successfully loaded.


### GenericObservationFacility and GenericObservationForm

You will have noticed our module consists of two classes that inherit from two
other classes.

`MyObservationFacility` is the class that will contain the "business logic"
for interacting with the remote observatory. This includes methods to submit
observations, check observation status, etc. It inherits from
`GenericObservationFacility`, which contains some functionality that all
observation facility classes will want.

`MyObservationFacilityForm` is the class that will display a GUI form for our
users to create an observation. We can submit observations programatically, but it
is also nice to have a GUI for our users to use.  The `GenericObservationForm`
class, just like the previous super class, contains logic and layout that all
observation facility form classes should contain.

### Implementing observation submission

Now that we have the skeleton on an observation module set up, we should make it
do something. Let's assume our observatory only requires us to send 2 parameters
(besides the target data): exposure\_time and exposure\_count. Let's start by
adding them to our form class:

```python
from django import forms
from tom_observations.facility import GenericObservationFacility, GenericObservationForm


class MyObservationFacilityForm(GenericObservationForm):
    exposure_time = forms.IntegerField()
    exposure_count = forms.IntegerField()
```

Notice that we've added the two field definitions on our form. We've also imported
the django form module with `from django import forms`.

Now if we click on the "MyFacility" button on the observation facility list on the
target page, we should see something like this:

![fields](/assets/img/observation_module/fields.png)


Now we'll implement the method that performs an action with our form when we
submit the observation request:

```python
class MyObservationFacility(GenericObservationFacility):
    name = 'MyFacility'
    form = MyObservationFacilityForm

    def submit_observation(self, observation_payload):
        print(observation_payload)
        return [1]

    def validate_observation(self, observation_payload):
        pass

    def get_observation_url(self, observation_id):
        return ''

    def get_observation_status(self, observation_id):
        return ['IN_PROGRESS']

    def get_terminal_observing_states(self):
        return ['IN_PROGRESS', 'COMPLETED']

    def get_observing_sites(self):
        return []

    def data_products(self, observation_id, proudct_id=None):
        return []

```

The important method here is `submit_observation`. This method, when implemented
fully, will send the observation payload to the remote observatory and then return
a list of observation ids. Those Ids will be stored in the database to be used
later: in methods like `get_observation_status(self, observation_id)`. In our
dummy implementation, we simply print out the observation payload and return
single fake id with  `return [1]`.

If you now "submit" an observation using the MyFacility module, you should see
this in the server console:

    {'target_id': 1, 'params': '{"facility": "MyFacility", "target_id": 1, "exposure_time": 23, "exposure_count": 2}'}

That was our print statement!

### Filling in the rest of the functionality
You'll notice we added many more methods other than `submit_observation` to our
Facility class. For now they return dummy data, but when you adapt it to work with
a real observatory you should fill them in with the correct logic so that the
whole module works correctly with the TOM. You can view explanations of each
method [in the source
code](https://github.com/TOMToolkit/tom_base/blob/master/tom_observations/facility.py#L135)


Happy developing!
