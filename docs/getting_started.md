title: Getting Started with the TOM Toolkit
---

So you've decided to run a Target Observation Manager. This article will help you get started.

The TOM Toolkit is a [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/) project. This means you'll be running
an application based on the Django framework when you run a TOM. If you decide to customize
your TOM, you'll be working in Django. You'll likely need some basic understanding of python
and we recommend all users work their way through the
[Django tutorial](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/2.1/contents/) first before starting with
the TOM Toolkit. It doesn't take long, and you most likely won't need to utilize any advanced
features.

Ready to go? Let's get started.

## Prerequisites

The TOM toolkit requires Python >= 3.7

If you are using Python 3.6 and cannot upgrade to 3.7, install the `dataclasses`
backport:

    pip install dataclasses

## Installing the TOM Toolkit and Django

First, we recommend using a
[virtual environment](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/venv.html) for your
project.
This will keep your TOM python packages seperate from your system python packages.

    python3 -m venv tom_env/

Now that we have created the virtual environment, we can activate it:

    source tom_env/bin/activate

You should now see `(tom_env)` prepended to your terminal prompt.

Now, install the TOM Toolkit:

    pip install tomtoolkit==0.3.1

...and create a new project, just like in the tutorial:

    django-admin startproject mytom

You should now have a fully functional standard Django installation inside the
`mytom` folder, with the TOM dependencies installed as well.

## Getting started with the `tom_setup` script.

We ned to add the `tom_setup` app to our project's `INSTALLED_APPS`. Locate the
`settings.py` file inside your project directory (usually in a subdirectory of the
main folder, i.e. mytom/mytom/settings.py) and edit it so that it looks like this:

```python
INSTALLED_APPS = [
    'django.contrib.admin',
    'django.contrib.auth',
    'django.contrib.contenttypes',
    'django.contrib.sessions',
    'django.contrib.messages',
    'django.contrib.staticfiles',
    'tom_setup',
]
```

## Run the setup script

The `tom_setup` app contains a script that will bootstrap a new TOM in your
current project. Run it:

    ./manage.py tom_setup

The install script will ask you a few questions and then install your TOM.

## Running the dev server

Now that the toolkit is installed, you're ready to try it out!

First, run the necessary migrations:

    ./manage.py migrate

Now, start the dev server:

    ./manage.py runserver

Your new TOM should now be running on [http://127.0.0.1:8000](http://127.0.0.1:8000)!
