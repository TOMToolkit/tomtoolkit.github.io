title: Scripting your TOM with a Jupyter Notebook
---

The TOM provides a graphical interface to perform many tasks, but there are many
tasks where writing code to interact with your TOM's data and functions may be
desirable.  In this tutorial we will explore how to interact with a TOM with code,
_programatically_, using a Jupyter notebook.


First install JupyterLab into your TOM's virtualenv:

    pip install jupyterlab

Then launch the notebook server:

    ./manage.py shell_plus --notebook


The notebook interface should open in your browser. Everything is the same as a
standard Jupyter Notebook, with the exception of an additional option under the
"new" menu. When creating a new notebook that interacts with your TOM, you should
use the `Django Shell-Plus` option instead of the regular Python 3 option. This will
open the notebook with the correct Django context loaded:

![new](/assets/img/jupyterdoc/newnotebook.png)

Creat a new notebook. Now that it's open, we can use it just like any other
Notebook.


### Creating Targets

We create targets by using the `Target` model and the `create` method. Let's
create a target for M51 using the bare necessary information:

```python
In [1]: from tom_targets.models import Target
   ...: t = Target.objects.create(name='m51', identifier='Messier 51', type='NON_SIDEREAL', ra=123.3, dec=23.3)
   ...: print(t)
   ...:
Target post save hook: Messier 51 created: True
Messier 51
```

Now we should have a target in our database for M51. We can fetch it now, or
anytime later:

```python
In [9]: target = Target.objects.get(name='m51')

In [10]: print(target)
Messier 51
```

We can access attributes of our target:

```python
In [13]: target.ra
Out[13]: 123.3

In [14]: target.future_observations
Out[14]: []
```

And if we tire of it, we can delete it entirely:

```python
In [15]: target.delete()
Out[15]:
(1,
 {'tom_targets.TargetExtra': 0,
  'tom_targets.TargetList_targets': 0,
  'tom_dataproducts.ReducedDatum': 0,
  'tom_targets.Target': 1})
```
See the [django documentation on making
queries](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/2.2/topics/db/queries/)
for more examples of what can be done with objects in our database.


### Submitting observations

Now that we have a target, we can submit an observation request using our
notebook, too.

Let's make some imports:

```python
In [16]:
from tom_targets.models import Target
from tom_observations.facilities.lco import LCOFacility, LCOObservationForm
```

And since we are submitting to LCO, we will instantiate an LCO observation form:

```python
In [17]:
form = LCOObservationForm({
    'name': 'Programmatic Observation',
    'proposal': 'LCOEngineering',
    'ipp_value': 1.05,
    'start': '2019-08-09T00:00:00',
    'end': '2019-08-10T00:00:00',
    'filter': 'R',
    'instrument_type': '1M0-SCICAM-SINISTRO',
    'exposure_count': 1,
    'exposure_time': 20,
    'max_airmass': 4.0,
    'observation_type': 'NORMAL',
    'target_id': target.id,
    'facility': 'LCO'
})
```

Is the form valid?

```python
In [18]: form.valid()
Out[18]: true
```

Let's submit the request:

```python
In [19]: observation_ids = LCOFacility().submit_observation(form.observation_payload())
         print(observation_ids)
Out[19]: [123456789]
```

And create records for them:

```python
In [20]:
or observation_id in observation_ids:
    record = ObservationRecord.objects.create(
        target=target,
        facility='LCO',
        parameters=form.serialize_parameters(),
        observation_id=observation_id
    )
    print(record)
Out[20]: M51 @ LCO
```

Now when we check our TOM interface, we should see that our target, M51, has a
pending observation!

### More possibilities

These are just a few examples of what's possible using the TOM's programmatic API.
In fact, you have complete control over your data when using this api. The best
way to learn what is possible is by [browsing the source
code](https://github.com/tomtoolkit/tom_base)
of the TOM Toolkit project.
